    <p class="text-justify">My name is <strong class="personal-name">Pastor Cortés Osorno</strong>, I'm a .NET Developer and I've been developing software for around 8 years. I created this blog because I consider it an oportunity to improve my technical skills because this kind of activity leads you to do study and research when you write a post. Furthermore, I'm a founding member of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DotNetNicaragua/" target="_blank">.NET community</a> in my country, I consider this would allow me to keep track of the talks I shared with the community.</p>
    
    <p class="text-justify">I studied a BS in Systems Engineering at <a href="https://www.uni.edu.ni/#/" target="_blank">National University of Engineering</a> from my country (Nicaragua), currently I work at <a href="http://ooqia.com/" target="_blank">OOQIA</a> which is a Software Development company, basically we are outsourced staff who develop software for clients in North America.</p>

<p class="text-justify">In my day to day, I work mostly in projects with MVC pattern using .NET Framework 4.x but of course, newer projects use .NET Core.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I have experience in front end development using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I use libraries like Jquery, Jquery validate, JSX Graph and chart JS. I also have some knowledge regarding the Javascript framework Angular.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Concerning to back end development, I have some experience designing web services (Web API, WCF and ASMX) and Windows Services for executing processes for a BPM plataform (BIZAGI). I've also worked designing reports using SSRS and Crystal Reports, my experience in database development it's mainly in Microsoft SQL Server but I've also worked with others RDBMs like IBM AS/400 DB2 and MySQL.</p>

<p class="text-justify">At my spare time, I like playing chess, I enjoy watching tv series or movies, my favorites are: Breaking Bad, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings... Also, I'm mentoring three guys from my community, it's being a rewarding experience to help other people to develop skills and of course I like to learn new technologies.</p>

<p class="text-justify">As a short term goal, I'm finishing my own preparation to become MCSD in Web Applications (I'm already a MCSA, this is my <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/pastor-cortes-osorno/badges" target="_blank">CCLAIM profile</a>). On the other hand, as a future goal I'm planning to study a MSc in Software Engineering, most probably in a university from the United Kingdom because I'd like to have a degree from an english speaking university. I think the most suitable option for me would be to study online in a part time modality (It would take two years), but I obviously need to keep working for paying the education fees.</p>
